            Brian Harold May, CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician,
            singer, songwriter and photographer. He is best known as the lead
            guitarist of the rock band Queen. In 2001, he was inducted into the
            Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the band's members; and in
            2018, he received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award which
            recognises "the most distinctive recordings in music history". He
            uses a home-built electric guitar called the Red Special. His
            compositions for the band include "We Will Rock You", "Tie Your
            Mother Down", "I Want It All", "Fat Bottomed Girls", "Flash",
            "Hammer to Fall", "Save Me", "Who Wants to Live Forever", and "The
            Show Must Go On".

            May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and
            drummer Roger Taylor, having previously performed with Taylor in the
            band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. Within
            five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass
            player John Deacon completing the lineup, Queen had become one of
            the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album A
            Night at the Opera and its song "Bohemian Rhapsody". From the
            mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant
            presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in
            the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at Live Aid
            in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso
            musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created
            through his layered guitar work.

            Following the death of Mercury in 1991, Queen were put on hiatus for
            several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for
            further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet
            Rock poll saw May voted the 7th greatest guitarist of all time. He
            was ranked at No. 26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "100
            Greatest Guitarists of All Time". In 2012, May was ranked the 2nd
            greatest guitarist of all time by a Guitar World magazine readers
            poll.
